# Title: "Rise to the Top"

(Verse 1)
Started from the bottom, now I'm climbing up the hill,
Life was full of struggle, but I’m working for the thrill.
Dreams in my pocket, I ain’t ever gonna stop,
Keep my eyes on the prize, I'm aiming for the top.

(Chorus)
I’m risin’ to the top, ain’t no time for the flop,
Every step I take, man, I’m giving all I got.
From the streets to the stars, no matter how far,
I’ll shine through the dark, ‘cause I’m built like a star.
